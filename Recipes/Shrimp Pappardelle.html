				<h2>Preparation:</h2>
				<p>Recipe source: "Chiocciole ai gamberi", <span>The Fine Art of Italian Cooking</span>, Giuliano Bugialli</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Soak the shrimp in a bowl of cold slightly diluted brine with the lemon cut in half for 30 minutes. Julienne the onion, half the garlic clove, and soak both in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes as well, and set aside until needed again.</li>
					<li>Once the shrimp are soaked, bring a pot of water to the boil, drain and rinse the shrimp under cold water, and add them to the pot of boiling water to cook for 2 minutes. Drain the shrimp, shell them, and cut off their tails. Then half or quarter them, depending on their original size, into manageable-sized pieces and place into a bowl.</li>
					<li>Clean the tomatoes, then cut them roughly, without removing the seeds or the skin, into 1 to 1/2 inch pieces and place them on top of the shrimp along with the chopped parsley. Then cut the celery into pieces about 1 to 2 inches long and julienne them, also adding them to the bowl.</li>
					<li>Drain the onion and garlic and add to the bowl. Oour the oil over and season with salt and pepper. Do not mix, but cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.</li>
					<li>When ready to serve, bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to the boil and to it add olive oil and the pappardelle. Cook the pasta according to the instructions specific to the brand, or until it has reached aldente. Drain the pasta, transfer back into the large pot, and add to it the sauce. Turn on the heat and mix the sauce and the pasta together well for about 2 mintues, or until the sauce has just started to steam and simmer. Then cover for another 2 minutes.</li>
					<li><em>To serve</em>, garnish with torn basil or parsley and top with freshly ground white or black pepper. <em>Note:</em> Never add grated cheese to an Italian pasta dish containing seafood.</li>
