				<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
				<p>Makes fries for 3-4 people</p>
				<ul>
					<li>4 large idaho or russet potatoes</li>
					<li>Cooking oil</li>
					<li>Optional: Lard</li>
					<li>Salt</li>
					<li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

				<h2>Preparation:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Fill a deep fryer with about 1 1/2 inches of oil. One can also, if one prefers, replace some or all of the oil with lard. Heat the oil to 400 degrees Farenheit.</li>
					<li>While the oil is heating, roughly scrub the skins of the potatoes under a tap to remove any dirt. Leaving the skins on, and removing any sprouts or rotten spots, slice the potatoes into fine thin strips using a mandolin or french fry slice. To use a knife to do this step is not impossible, however it would prove very difficult and make the potato slices less uniform.</li>
					<li>Wash the slices in cold water and then dry them thoroughly with a towel.</li>
					<li>When the oil is hot, place half of the fries into the deep fryer. Spread and move them around with a slotted spoon, making sure they get a coating of oil and they don't stick to one another. Leave the fries in the oil, stirring occasionally, until they are able to retain their shape and just beginning to color collectively.</li>
					<li>When the fries are done with their first frying, take them from the deep fryer with a slotted spoon and place them onto a platter lined with generous amounts of paper towels. Spread them out on the paper towels and agitate them with your hands to get the oil off. If this step is not done they will get soggy.</li>
					<li>Repeat the frying process with the remaining potato slices.</li>
					<li>Once all of the fries have been through their first frying, dry them with paper towels and let them rest slightly while the oil in the fryer heats again to 400 degrees. Once the oil is hot, add all of the fries into the fryer in one batch. Spread the fries around in the oil, stirring and agitating for about 3 minutes, or until the fries are crispy and satisfactorily golden brown.</li>
					<li>When done with their final fry, remove the fries with a slotted spoon onto a platter lined with fresh paper towels. Rub off the excess oil, let the fries cool, and sprinkle generously with salt and a little bit of black pepper before serving.</li>
