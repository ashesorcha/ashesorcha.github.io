				<h2>Preparation:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Preheat the oven to around 390 degrees Farenheit or 200 degrees Celcius if you are planning to bake the scones right away.</li>
					<li>Sieve flour, salt, and baking powder into a large bowl and stir in the sugar.</li>
					<li>Break and blend in the butter by hand until the mixture resembles bread crumbs.</li>
					<li>Beat the eggs into the milk. Form a well in the dry ingredients and pour the wet mixture into the well, retaining a little for the egg wash.</li>
					<li>Now is the time to add any additional flavoring ingredients to the scones (e.g. berries, nuts, etc). Using your hands, fold the elements together just to combine into a soft dough. Do not overmix the dough, as overmixing will make the scones dense and loose their flakiness.</li>
					<li>On a floured surface, roll or pat the dough to a one inch thickness. Cut the dough into similar-sized portions with a knife or cookie cutter.</li>
					<li>One can choose either to bake the scones immediately or freeze the cut dough for later use.<em> To bake</em>, place the scones on a lined baking sheet and bake in the oven for around 20-30 minutes, or until the tops have turned golden brown, cracks have appeared on the sides, and the dough is firm but springs back when touched.</li>
					<li><em>To freeze</em>, place the unbaked dough cut-outs into a lined container and store in the freezer until ready to bake. When wanted again, preheat the oven, take the scones out of the freezer, place them on a lined baking sheet to defrost for around 15 minutes, and bake according to previous directions.</li>
					<li><em>To serve</em>, pair these scones with butter, cream, and jam. They can also be eaten with berries, nuts, and whatever else you choose.</li>
